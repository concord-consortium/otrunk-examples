Gas: A <b>gas</b> is a state in which matter has no definite shape or volume, for example, air.

Liquid: A <b>liquid</b> is a state in which matter has a definite volume but no definite shape, for example, drinking water.

Solid: <b>solid</b> is a state in which matter has a definite volume and shape, for example, earth. 

Water cycle: The <b>Water cycle</b> is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the earth. It includes water as a liquid, as ice and snow, and as water vapor.

Matter: <b>Matter</b> is anything that takes up space. Solid, liquid and gas are all states of matter.
 
Water vapor: <b>Water vapor</b> is water in its state as a gas.
                        
Cloud: A <b>cloud</b> is water in the air in the form of tiny water droplets or ice crystals. 

Fog: <b>Fog</b> is a cloud near the ground.

Ice:  <b>Ice</b> is water in its state as a solid. Ice is a crystal.

Evaporation:  <b>Evaporation</b> is the process of changing from a liquid to a gas, for example, water changing from a liquid into water vapor. 

Condensation:  <b>Condensation</b> is the process of changing from a gas to a liquid, for example, water changing from water vapor into a liquid.

Atmosphere: The <b>Atmosphere</b> is the layer of air that surrounds the earth. It is made up of a mixture of gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. The atmosphere is only about 20 km (12 miles) thick. 

Humidity: <b>Humidity</b> is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. 

Humid: <b>Humid</b> means that there is a lot of water vapor in the air. 

Humidity: <b>Humidity</b> is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air.

Relative humidity: <b>Relative humidity</b> is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum the air can hold at that temperature.


Precipitation: <b>Precipitation</b> is any form of water that falls on the earth. It includes rain (water droplets), snow (ice crystals), sleet (frozen water droplets) and hail (big frozen water droplets). 

Percent: <b>Percent</b> means "out of 100". 

Melting: <b>Melting</b> is the process of changing from a solid to a liquid.

Freezing: <b>Freezing</b> is the process of changing from a liquid to a solid.
