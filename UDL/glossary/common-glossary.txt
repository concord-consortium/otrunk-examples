Grid: A <b>grid</b> is a square pattern of lines.

Temperature: <b>Temperature</b> is the measure of how fast molecules in a material are wiggling or vibrating.

Kinetic energy: <b>Kinetic energy</b> is the energy of motion. If an object is not moving, its kinetic energy is zero.

Energy: <b>Energy</b> is a property of materials that can be used to heat things. The total amount of energy in a system doesn't change.

Estimate: <b>Estimate</b> is to make a careful guess of the numerical value of something.

Hypothesis: A <b>hypothesis</b> is a prediction or careful guess about how something will work.
