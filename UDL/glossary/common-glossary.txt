Analogy: An <b>analogy</b> is a comparison between two situations or things that are alike in some ways but different in others.

Atom: An <b>atom</b> is a very small piece of matter. Several atoms joined together are called molecules.


Humidity: <b>Humidity</b> is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. It is measured as the percentage relative to the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at that temperature.

Humid: <b>Humid</b> means that there is a lot of water vapor in the air. 

Computer model: A <b>computer model</b> is a program that runs on a computer and imitates the real world in some way.

Evidence: <b>Evidence</b> is what you observe or measure to support an idea.

Average:  <b>Average</b> is the middle of a set of values. To calculate it, add up the values and divide by how many there are.

Grid: A <b>grid</b> is a square pattern of lines.

Temperature: <b>Temperature</b> is the measure of how fast molecules in a material are wiggling or vibrating.

Heat: <b>Heat</b> is a form of energy that consists of wiggling or motion of molecules. The faster the molecules wiggle, the hotter the material.

Kinetic energy: <b>Kinetic energy</b> is the energy of motion. If an object is not moving, its kinetic energy is zero.

Potential energy: <b>potential energy</b> is stored-up energy, such as a stretched rubber band, chemical energy in a battery, or a car at the top of a hill.

Energy: <b>Energy</b> is a property of materials that can be used to heat things. It can take many forms, such as motion, electrical or chemical energy,  The total amount of energy in a system doesn't change.

Estimate: <b>Estimate</b> is to make a careful guess of the numerical value of something.

Cycle: A <b>cycle</b> means something that repeats over and over again, like traveling around in a circle or swinging back and forth.

Hypothesis: A <b>hypothesis</b> is a prediction or careful guess about how something will work. 

Molecule: A <b>molecule</b> is a group of atoms that are joined together.

Monitor: To <b>monitor</b> is to observe something carefully over a period of time. 

Outlier: An <b>outlier</b> in a collection of measurements is one that is very different from the others.

Percent: <b>Percent</b> means "out of 100" or "compared to 100". For example, if 30 kids in a class of 100 have brown hair, then 30 percent have brown hair.  

Predict: To <b>predict</b> is to make a careful guess about how something will happen.

Prediction: A <b>prediction</b> is a careful guess about how something will happen.

Ratio: A <b>ratio</b> of two numbers is one divided by the other. For example, the ratio of 6 to 2 (or 6:2) is 6 divided by 2, or 3.
