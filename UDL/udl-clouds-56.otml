                                  It was a hot day, but Natasha and Marc were cold! They were at the 
          beach, lying on their backs, staring up at the sky, and watching a 
          seagull soaring back and forth. They had just come out of the water 
          and were waiting for the sun to dry them off.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Where does the 
          water go?" asked Natasha. She was just going into the third grade 
          and was always asking questions.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Marc was two years older 
          than his sister, so he knew the answers to most of her questions. At 
          least he thought he did! "It doesn't go anywhere," he said. "It just 
          disappears."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "It can't just disappear!" said Natasha, 
          frowning. "Things don't just disappear."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "What 
          about that rabbit?" asked Marc.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "What rabbit?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "The 
          one that disappeared into the hat when the magician waved his wand 
          at that show."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "That's different," said Natasha. "That 
          was magic."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Well, maybe the water disappearing is 
          magic, too."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "I don't think so," said Natasha. "Mom said that magic isn't real."

                                  "You never know," said Marc with a knowing look. Actually, he wasn't 
          sure where the water went, but he didn't want Natasha to think he 
          didn't know something as simple as that. Natasha looked up to Marc a 
          lot. She thought he knew just about everything!
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  To change the subject, Marc said, "That cloud looks like an elephant!" He 
          pointed.
                                  <br />
                                  "See, that's its trunk and that's—"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "What are clouds made of?" asked Natasha.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Cotton candy," 
          said her brother, with a sigh. Natasha's questions could be awfully 
          annoying sometimes!
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Are you sure?" said Natasha, doubtfully. 
          "You mean like we had at the fair?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Marc was just 
          about to tell Natasha to quit asking all these dumb questions when a 
          shadow fell across them both. Turning his head to one side, he saw a 
          tall lady standing over them.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "I wouldn't be so sure about 
          that," said the lady, "though I do admit that some clouds look like 
          cotton candy."

                                  Marc and Natasha sat up. They squinted into the sun to see the tall 
          lady who had spoken to them.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  She was dressed very strangely. 
          For one thing, she didn't have a swimsuit on like everyone else on 
          the beach. Instead she was wearing a long purple dress that reached 
          all the way down to her ankles. She wore an enormous hat and big, 
          dark sunglasses, and she had a small pack on her back. But the most 
          peculiar thing of all was her shoes. They had high heels and they 
          sparkled in the sun as though they were made of gold!
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Where 
          did you come from?" asked Marc.

                                  "And why aren't you 
          wearing a swimsuit?" asked Natasha. "And how can you walk on the 
          beach in those shoes?" she added.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "What's the matter?" 
          said the lady. "Don't you like my shoes?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Well, 
          sure we do," said Marc, anxious not to annoy her. "It's just that…"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "I'm 
          not wearing a swimsuit," the lady went on, "because I don't intend 
          to swim. And I'm here because you, young man, told a fib!" She took 
          off her sunglasses and stared at Marc with bright blue eyes that 
          seemed to see right through him.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "What fib?" asked Marc, 
          weakly. "You said clouds were made of cotton candy!" answered 
          Natasha. "I knew that sounded fishy."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Well, if 
          they're not cotton candy, what are they made of?" asked Marc.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "There's 
          only one way to find out," said the lady, "and that's to go up there 
          and see for yourselves."

                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Oh, there are ways," said Elvira. "You could fly! Oh, yes. I could teach you 
          how! But you'd have to really, really want to. And you'd have to be 
          very brave, of course."

                                  Marc wasn't sure what they were getting into, but before he could say 
          anything, Natasha piped up, "We're brave! We're brave as anything! 
          Just show us how to fly!"

                                  "Now then," said Elvira as the children brushed the sand off their 
          wet suits. "Hold your arms out like this. Make a 'T.'"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  As Natasha and Marc did this, a curious thing happened. The sounds of the 
          other children playing on the beach nearby seemed to fade away. So 
          did the voices of the grownups. Even the yapping of two little dogs 
          that were running in and out of the waves got softer and softer 
          until they could no longer be heard. And as though a cloud were 
          passing in front of the sun, the rest of the beach seemed to get 
          darker somehow until it too faded away, and Natasha and Marc and 
          Elvira were left in a little circle of sunshine all their own. It 
          was almost as if they were the last people on Earth!
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "There, that should do it," said Elvira.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Whaa – what's going on?" asked Marc. "Where is everybody?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Oh, they're still there," said Elvira. "They're just not paying attention to 
          us any more. No sense creating a sensation, you know! People are so 
          curious!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  As she said this, Marc's shoulders started to feel itchy. It felt as though a 
          family of ants were crawling all over them. "This is scary!" he 
          thought to himself, but for some reason he didn't feel scared. He 
          looked at Natasha. She didn't look scared, either. She just looked 
          surprised. She was staring at him until her eyes nearly popped out 
          of her head.

                                  "You're sprouting wings!" she said. She craned her neck to look down her back. 
          "And so am I!"

                                  Sure enough, two little white wings were popping out from Natasha's 
          shoulders. As Marc watched, the wings grew wider and longer. Pretty 
          soon Natasha had the most beautiful wings he had ever seen! They 
          looked like a seagull's wings, only they were much bigger. By this 
          time Marc's own wings had grown until they were even bigger than 
          Natasha's. When he spread them out he could easily touch the ground 
          with their tips on either side. He tried beating them up and down a 
          few times just to see what would happen, but his feet stayed right 
          where they were on the ground.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "What's the matter, Elvira?" he said. "Why can't I fly? What am I doing wrong?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "You need to move your wings in little circles, not just up and down.  Oh, 
          yes!" said Elvira. Somehow she had sprouted wings, too, while the 
          children weren't watching, or maybe she had had them all along. 
          "Hunch your shoulders forward when you bring your wings down, like 
          this." Elvira demonstrated. Slowly she rose in the air about ten 
          feet and remained there, beating her wings and smiling down at the 
          kids.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  It took a little practice, but pretty soon Marc and Natasha could fly, too. 
          It was great fun! They flew over the beach and then out over the 
          ocean. They swooped down so low over the water that they got their 
          feet wet. They tried to chase a seagull, but he was too fast for 
          them.

                                  But it was hard work! They had to keep beating their wings in order 
          to stay up and it was even harder if they wanted to climb. In no 
          time at all they were out of breath and panting.

                                  "How do the 
          – puff, puff! – seagulls do it?" asked Marc. "They hardly seem – 
          puff! – to move their wings at all."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "They use the 
          thermals," said Elvira, who didn't seem out of breath at all. "That 
          way the air does most of the work."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "What are thermals?" 
          asked Marc. He didn't really care what they were, but the idea of 
          letting the air do the work appealed to him.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "They're places 
          where the air rises," said Elvira. "Here, let me show you." She flew 
          toward the beach. "Let's see. They're usually found above hot places 
          like the hot sand on the beach. Ah, here's one! Watch me!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Elvira 
          spread her wings way out and stopped beating them. Amazingly, she 
          started to go up. She tipped her wings just a little and turned to 
          the left. She kept turning and rising. It looked easy, just as 
          though she were climbing a spiral staircase in the sky! When she got 
          to a hundred feet or so, she stopped turning and swooped down toward 
          the children. "Now you try it!" she said. Natasha and Marc rushed to 
          the spot where they had seen Elvira start her climb. Sure enough 
          they didn't have to beat their wings very much to stay up. As long 
          as they stayed over that spot they could just keep on climbing with 
          practically no effort.

                                  For several minutes Natasha and Marc practiced using the thermal 
          that Elvira had found. As long as they stayed over the beach they 
          didn't have to work very hard to climb. When they got high enough 
          they would leave the thermal and come swooping down over the ocean. 
          It felt just like sledding down a hill. It was really great fun and 
          they would have kept on doing it for a long time if Elvira hadn't 
          reminded them of something.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Remember how all this started," she said. "Natasha wanted to know what 
          clouds are made of."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "And you said we'd have to visit them to find out," Marc said. "Were you 
          serious? Could we really fly that high?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "See that cloud?" said Elvira, pointing to a small fluffy cloud directly 
          overhead. "I bet that's not more than a mile up. We can do it 
          easily. Yes we can!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  A mile sounded like quite a lot to Marc, but before he could say anything 
          Natasha and Elvira had started to climb the thermal. He followed 
          them, wondering why Natasha seemed to trust Elvira so much. She 
          would follow her anywhere, it seemed.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  The three of them flew up and up. It hardly took any effort at all, just a 
          nudge of their wings every once in a while to make sure they stayed 
          inside the column of rising air. The beach below them got smaller 
          and smaller and they could see the houses behind it and a long 
          highway behind the houses. They had driven on that highway to come 
          out to the beach from the city where they lived.

                                  As they climbed higher it got colder and colder. Pretty soon Natasha 
          and Marc were shivering and their teeth were chattering. Elvira 
          didn't seem to mind the cold, but when she noticed that the children 
          were cold, she reached into her backpack and brought out two cloaks. 
          They were made of some thin material and had holes where the wings 
          could poke through. They were very light, but also very warm. In a 
          minute Natasha and Marc were comfortable again.

                                  <br />
                                  As soon as her teeth stopped chattering, Natasha asked, "Why is it colder 
          higher up?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "It's like when we went up in the mountains that time," replied Marc. 
          "Remember? There was snow all year round up there!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "I know, but why?" When Natasha had a question she was like a dog with a bone 
          – she just wouldn't let go till she was satisfied with the answer.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Elvira seemed to sense this. She took the time to give Natasha a good answer. 
          "Remember how hard it was to fly high before you discovered 
          thermals?" she asked. Natasha nodded. "So think how hard you would 
          have had to work to make it all the way up here! It would have taken 
          all your energy to do that, yes sir! Well the air has to use up a 
          lot of its energy to rise, too. And the energy in air is in the form 
          of heat. That hot air down there on the beach had a tremendous 
          amount of energy. That's how it could lift us all the way up here. 
          But it lost a lot of its energy climbing and that's why it's gotten 
          so cold."

                                  "I get it," said Marc. And he did!

          the sun and looking less and less like cotton candy. In fact, it 
          looked vaguely familiar. Marc was trying to think where he had seen 
          something like this before. Then he remembered.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "It looks like a fog bank!" he said.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "A what?" asked Natasha. "A bank for fog instead of money?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "No, no," said Marc. "Remember when we were at grandma's that time and it got 
          foggy all of a sudden? That was because a fog bank came rolling in 
          off the ocean. One minute it was perfectly clear and the next minute 
          you couldn't see two feet in front of you."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Oh yeah, now I remember," said Natasha. "It was spooky!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Well, this may be a little spooky, too," said Elvira. "You two stay real 
          close to me, you hear? We're about to enter the cloud. There's 
          nothing to be afraid of, we'll just keep going up and we'll pop 
          right out the top."

                                  As she said this, the air around them started to get really choppy. 
          To Natasha and Marc it felt like trying to swim in the ocean when 
          there were lots of waves. Instead of just moving up steadily in lazy 
          circles as they had been doing, now they were being pushed around a 
          lot. They'd be flying nicely side by side a few feet apart and then 
          a big gust of wind would come along and push them in different 
          directions and they'd have to beat their wings really hard to come 
          back together again. This went on for several minutes and then 
          Elvira said, "Grab my hands now, we're going into the cloud!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Natasha held very tightly to Elvira's hand. The wind was very fierce now and 
          it was getting really foggy. Looking down, she could no longer see 
          the beach and the houses and the highway. Everywhere she looked she 
          saw nothing but grey fog. Even Marc, who was only a few feet away 
          holding Elvira's other hand, was beginning to disappear into the 
          fog. Natasha's face and hands were getting wet. The wind was howling 
          in her ears. She squeezed Elvira's hand as tightly as she could.

                                  "I don't like this cloud!" said Natasha.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Elvira's voice was soothing. It seemed to come to Natasha from inside her own 
          head, cutting through the noise of the wind. "It's all right," said 
          Elvira. "It's not dangerous. In fact, it's really interesting, oh 
          yes!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Will we be in it long?" asked Marc. His voice seemed to Natasha to be coming 
          from far, far away.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Not very long," answered Elvira. "This is just a little cloud and the air is 
          still rising inside it. We should be through it in just a few 
          minutes."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Natasha was still a little scared, but she had to admit this cloud was indeed 
          pretty amazing! Her curiosity overcame her fear. "Why is everything 
          so wet?" she asked.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Remember your question?" said Elvira. "Well, now you've got your answer."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "You mean clouds are made of water?" said Natasha. "That's really weird!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "I knew they weren't really cotton candy," said Marc. "I was just fooling. 
          But there's something I don't understand. If clouds are made of 
          water, where does the water come from?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "That's easy," said Elvira. "It climbs up just the way we did. The rising air 
          carries it up here, just as it carried you and Natasha."

                                  "But I didn't see any water on the way up," said Natasha. "And water 
          doesn't have wings. Water can't fly like a bird. That doesn't make 
          sense!"
                                  <br />

                                  "
Sure it does!" said Elvira. "Think back. What were you doing before you 
          asked what clouds were made of?"
                                  <br />

                                  "We were looking for shapes," Marc remembered. "I saw a cloud that looked like 
          an elephant, and…"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "No, before that," said Elvira. "Natasha asked a different question, 
          remember?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "We were drying off," said Natasha, "and I asked where the water went. And 
          Marc said it just disappeared."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Well, it does disappear," said Elvira. "But it doesn't go away. It just 
          becomes invisible."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Invisible?" asked Marc. "How does it do that?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "When water gets hot it turns from a liquid into a gas," said Elvira. "The gas 
          is called water vapor. You can't see it, but it's part of the air 
          all around you."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "You mean, like steam?" asked Natasha.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "No. You can see steam, but water vapor is invisible. Steam is made of little 
          drops of liquid water. Water vapor is what you get when those drops 
          evaporate and turn into a gas. There's water vapor in the air all 
          the time even though you can't see it. When you were drying off, the 
          water on your body was evaporating – turning into water vapor. So it 
          disappeared, but it didn't go away."

                                  The fog that was a cloud seemed to be getting thinner. Looking up, 
          Natasha could see a bit of sunlight peeking through. She was glad 
          that they were almost out of the cloud, but she still had one more 
          question.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "If water vapor is invisible," she asked, "why can we can see clouds?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Marc had the answer. "Because clouds aren't made of water vapor!" he 
          said, triumphantly. "They're made of regular, liquid water. That's 
          why our faces and hands have been getting wet."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "That's exactly right, Marc!" said Elvira. She looked at him approvingly. Marc 
          smiled proudly. "When the air gets cold, it can't hold as much water 
          vapor," Elvira went on. "So the water vapor condenses back into 
          little droplets. Condensation is the opposite of evaporation."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "And clouds are just lots and lots and lots of little water droplets?" asked 
          Natasha.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Yes, and sometimes little bits of ice, too," said Elvira. "But I don't see 
          any ice in this cloud. I guess it isn't cold enough."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "It's plenty cold enough for me," said Marc.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Me, too," said Natasha.

                                  Just then they popped out of the cloud. It was quite sudden. The fog 
          lifted and the sun shone brightly. The warmth of the sun felt good 
          on their backs. The cloud was just below them.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "You know what?" said Marc. "Even though we've just been through it and we 
          know it's made of water, it still looks like cotton candy!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Notice something else?" asked Elvira. "Our thermal is gone!" Sure enough, 
          they had stopped climbing and they had to flap their wings to keep 
          from falling back through the cloud. "The air kept on rising and 
          cooling until it cooled so much that it couldn't rise any more," 
          said Elvira.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "How are we going to get back down?" asked Natasha, a little uncertainly. "I 
          bet Mom and Dad are missing us!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Don't worry about them," said Elvira. "They won't notice a thing. As for 
          getting back down," she went on, "we could fly down or if you two 
          are getting bored..."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Oh, we're not bored!" said Natasha, "It's just that…"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "I understand," said Elvira, "It's been fun, but now you'd like this little 
          adventure to end. Of course, you would! And we can do that, too. 
          Just hold my hands real tight and close your eyes."

                                  There was a small popping sound. All of a sudden Natasha found that 
          she was no longer holding Elvira's hand. The sound of the wind had 
          gone away very suddenly, too, and in its place Natasha heard 
          children playing and mothers calling to them not to go out too deep. 
          She opened her eyes. She was lying on her back on the beach. Her 
          beach towel was next to her just as she had left it. The cloak 
          Elvira had given her was gone, though. She turned to look at Marc, 
          who was just scrambling to his feet. His cloak was gone, too. His 
          back was all sandy and there were no signs of wings between his 
          shoulders.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Where is she?" he asked. "What happened to Elvira?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "I think she's gone," said Natasha, sadly. She checked her own back, but she 
          knew what she would find. Sure enough, her wings were gone, too.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Marc was looking around. "Look!" he said "She didn't even leave any footprints 
          in the sand. It's as though she wasn't real!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "But we know she was here," said Natasha, "and we know we flew up into that 
          cloud and got water in our faces. We know it really happened, 
          right?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Uh, right," said Marc. But he sounded a little doubtful.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  A drop of water hit Natasha on the shoulder. Then another one hit the other 
          shoulder. "Children," called their mother, "it's starting to rain. 
          Get your things together, we're going home!"

                                  The windshield wipers made a swishing noise as they swept back and 
          forth. The headlights glinted off the wet road. Natasha and Marc 
          were in the back seat of the big, dark car, talking softly to each 
          other. Their parents were in the front, listening to the radio. They 
          had never even noticed that their children had been gone all that 
          time! Natasha and Marc hadn't told them what had happened. They were 
          afraid that their parents wouldn't believe them. Sometimes they 
          wondered themselves whether it had all been a dream.

                                  "I'm sure it was real!" Natasha whispered to Marc. "I'm just sure of it!"

                                  "Then how come no one noticed?" asked Marc. "We were gone a long time. How 
          come no one missed us?"
                                  <br />

                                  "I don't know," said Natasha. "It was magic, I guess."

                                  <br />
                                  "You said there was no such thing," Marc reminded her.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "But Elvira is different," said Natasha. "She's

                                  magic!"

                                  "If she even exists!" said Marc, but he said it so softly that Natasha didn't 
          hear him.

                                  "Where does the water go?" she asked.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />

                                  <br />
                                  "I don't know," said Marc. "Maybe it just turns back into water vapor and 
          becomes invisible again."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "But then sooner or later all the water in the world would end up in the 
          air," said Natasha. "I don't get it."
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Suddenly a familiar voice sounded in Natasha's head. "Look around you," the 
          voice said. "Where do you think all that rain came from?"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Natasha looked at Marc and Marc looked at Natasha. They smiled. Natasha could 
          tell that Marc had heard the voice, too.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "Now I see," said Natasha. "The cloud dumps its water on us and we call it 
          rain!"
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "And then the water heats up and evaporates and turns into water vapor. And 
          then it goes up in the air and condenses and turns back into a 
          cloud," said Marc.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  "It goes round and round!" said Natasha, happily.

                                  Their mother turned around to look them. "What are you children

          around to face the front again.

                                  In the Drawing Tool below, a giant puddle of water is shown, which represents all the water in the oceans. If all the snow and ice in the world melted into a puddle next to this one, how big would this other puddle be? Next to the graphic of the ocean water, use the Drawing Tool to draw what you think the size of this snow and ice puddle would be in relation to the ocean.  This stamp represents the amount of salt water in all the oceans of the Earth.

                                  Most of the water on the Earth (over 96%) is in the oceans, seas and bays, and is salty. We can't drink that water, or use it for agriculture, and we don't use saltwater in our homes. That leaves less than 4% of the water for use by humans and many plants and animals. And half of that water is permanently frozen! The fresh water available for human use is limited, and it is important to conserve our fresh water and protect it from being wasted or polluted.
                                  <p />
                                  Why haven't we run out of water already? Well, the answer is clouds. Clouds are an important part of the water cycle, a process that recycles water. It helps get water from the ocean back into fresh water we can drink!
                                  <p />
                                  Water vapor, the form of water that is a gas, is released by plants (transpiration) and evaporates from lakes, the ocean and the surface of the Earth.

                                  <p />
                                  When conditions are right, water turns back into a liquid in the form of tiny droplets.
                                  <p />
                                  <img src="http://udl.concord.org/share/Clouds/condensation.png" />
                                  <p />
                                  As the tiny droplets form, they start to clump together and increase in size. When the droplets are big enough, they fall to the ground as precipitation.

                                  Water is made up of molecules, tiny particles that we can't see with the naked eye. In solids, like ice, the molecules are bound tightly to each other. In liquids, the molecules are bound more loosely to each other, and they can move and the liquid can change shape. In gases, like water vapor, the molecules are free and move through space. Clouds are made of water droplets. Water vapor from the air condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water. As more and more of the water vapor condenses, the droplets get bigger. When they get big enough, they precipitate as rain, or even snow.
                                  <p />
                                  Here's one way to picture it.
                                  <p />
                                  Look at the three boxes below from about arm's length away. What do you see in each box?
                                  <p />
                                  Now look at the three boxes up close. What do you see in each box?
                                  <p />
                                  Each box has 20 dots in it. When they are in large groups (Box A) it is like rain droplets, and you can see them. When they are in small groups (Box B) it is like clouds or fog. When they are spread out (Box C), it is like water vapor. The individual molecules are invisible because they are so small.

                                  The key to change of state is the change in the energy in the system. As you saw in the model, heating water up, or adding heat energy made it change state.
                                  <p />
                                  First, you observed water change from solid to liquid (ice to liquid water). The solid water has a regular pattern, with molecules bound tightly together. The solid water does not change shape, and has the lowest total energy:

                                  As the heat energy was added and the total energy of the water increased, eventually the molecules started to move around and the object changed shape. The change of state from solid to liquid is what we call melting it takes energy to melt water, which is why we added heat energy:

                                  What happens in cooling is the exact reverse of the heating process. Instead of taking in more heat energy, the water molecules are giving off heat energy. When a gas loses energy, it moves back into the compact liquid form in a process called condensation:

                                  You can see that the total energy in the liquid form is lower than that in the gas form. This water has given off heat energy as it condensed.
                                  <p />
                                  Finally, the liquid water can be turned back into ice, or solid water. This process is called freezing. You have to take a lot of heat energy away to freeze water; a freezer works pretty hard to pump the heat energy away, allowing water to freeze:
                                  <p />

                                  <p />
                                  You can see that the solid has the least total energy, just as it began. In fact, it takes the same amount of energy to heat the water through these changes of state as is released by the water when it returns from gas to liquid to solid, its original state!

                                  The air near the bowl representing the coast was more humid. That means there was more water in the air. As the lamp warmed up the bowls, adding heat energy, some of the water in the sand evaporated. When it condensed on the plastic wrap, you could see it as a cloudy film. This cloudy film represents a cloud.

                                  On the Earth, there is generally more humidity near the coast of oceans and very large lakes. The water vapor in the air can form water droplets in clouds, and eventually fall to the ground as precipitation in the form of rain or snow. For this reason, clouds form more often near large bodies of water and those areas generally receive more precipitation.
